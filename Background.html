                <h1>Introduction</h1>
                <p>I was born on january 17, in punjab in India. I spent my whole childhood in the woods of the great India 
                and experiencing the diverse culture of India. I moved to Canada when I was 19 years old because of some circumstances 
                and I never wanted to leave India . Since i am living in Canada is by far the best time of my life and 
                I think it is the best decision I have ever made. However India you was, you are, you will always be missed.</p>
