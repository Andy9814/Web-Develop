                <p>I feel like I enjoy programming when I know what I'm doing, but when I don't know how to do something I get pretty frustrated and uninterested. I don't know any full languages yet, but I amlearning C++ java html. Anyway I think it's important for me to actively learn to enjoy programming, because otherwise I'm just wasting my spare time. 
                 I want to be able to do this now so I have the will-power to keep learning when I move into my career. Also because it's rad as hell being able to create things that can do anything you want (within reason).</p>

                <p>I love gardening in my spare time. It relax me.Well, doing an activity that is not normally part of your daily routine breaks the monotony and actually provides your mind and body a chance to re-channel some energy and release some pent-up emotions.
                    Gardening gives me an opportunity to take my mind off daily tasks and problems and concentrate on another task entirely. Thus, it serves as some sort of replacement therapy. It forces me to relax because me mind is no longer dwelling on the pressing problems and issues that were bothering me before.</p>

                <p>I read in my leasure time.There’s something about reading that I just cannot describe. It makes me forget about the troubles in my life and helps me transcend into a world that is very different from mine.</p>
