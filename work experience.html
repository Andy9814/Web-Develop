                <p>Tim Hortons was an excellent first job. I obtained many skills such as: learning how to handle money, polite customer service, and learning how to work as a team with my fellow co workers. When I received my promotion it became a whole new ball game. You had to be so much more aware of everything that is happening in the front of the house and back. Although challenging it provided a fun and exciting time for me and my staff!</p>

                <p>I worked at computershare aka ricepoint for an overall 3 months. The location was great and our cafeteria was amazingly clean and accessible it was a really wonderful environment to work in. This was a fun workplace, the atmosphere among employees was great. The pay however was ridiculously low for a company in the securities industry.</p>

                <p>I worked there 6 months. McDonald's teaches you the basics if you've taken any interest in working with food. It helped me get through school and paying my outside expenditures.</p>
